Working on the voxel engine was a difficult process. I've had to do a lot of debugging, and very few even displayed anything abnormal to the screen. When bugs do manifest visually, however, it's a nice change, because it allows you to think more creatively about what the problem could be (and usually solve the problem much faster). I've documented some of the more interesting visual bugs below.

These screenshots are the result of the octree being incorrectly stored. Volumes filled with only one type of mass may have to be divided further if a vertex must lie in that volume, i.e. if there is a different type of mass that lies along its edge. If that condition is ignored, then this result is produced. I think it's interesting because you can see the octree in the rendered mesh.

This is the result of a failure when the program is reading from file. In this case, the program was saving the file differently than it was reading it, which manifests in this interesting formation.
