The unknown variable can be inserted as a pair with some special rules for each possibility, with the unknown variable on the left and the possibility on the right. The first rule is that each parameter that the right hand node accepts is a new unknown variable. Each of those unknown variables’ signatures are the same as the root node’s corresponding argument, but with the left hand node’s argument signatures tacked on as extra arguments. In addition to being added as pairs, their types must be added as pairs as well.

The general rule is that if an unknown’s substitution variable is referenced by another unknown’s signature, it should not be solved for. The exception is in the case of circular loops, because then there can be a situation where no unknown meets the criteria. Reference loops should usually be avoided, but as long as all axioms and targets are well-formed and consistent, they cause no problems with the algorithm. (If the input is valid, then any condition that would cause the algorithm to do an infinite substitution would sooner cause the algorithm to return ‘no solution’. And not as a cheap workaround either- there is strictly no solution in that case.) After the algorithm makes a bunch of binding objects representing attempts at solving one of the unknowns with an axiom, each binding object is simplified and split into solved forms. Some binding objects will fail, which means that axiom cannot be used to satisfy that unknown. Other binding objects will split into many solutions, meaning there is more than one way to apply that axiom in that case. Each application of an axiom may create more unknowns that need to be solved for, and it may coincidentally specify unknowns besides the one being solved for." />

The most difficult concept to grasp in type theory is that predicates are types. The image below shows the signatures of some examples. Predicates/types may be true, false, or unprovable, but what proves a predicate to be true is if it is inhabited. In other words, if there is a valid statement whose type is predicate P, then P is proven, and the statement is its proof.
