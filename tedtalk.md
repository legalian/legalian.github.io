This was something I spent a lot of time preparing for. Most of my projects involve a lot of development work, so this kind of presentation was a change of pace for me. The purpose of the ted talk was to explain the concept of a neural network to an audience who had no experience with them. I wanted to stress that machine learning techniques are best used in combination with other tools in a computer scientistâ€™s toolbox, because I see high school students struggle with this a lot when they investigate neural networks.
